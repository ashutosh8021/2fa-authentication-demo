**2FA Demo Web Application**
*Two-Factor Authentication Implementation*

**Project Overview:**
- Course: [Your Course Name]
- Student: [Your Name]
- Date: August 2025
- Technology Stack: Flask, Python, SQLite, HTML/CSS

---

## Slide 2: Problem Statement
**Security Challenge: Password-Only Authentication**

🚨 **Current Issues:**
- Many web applications rely only on passwords
- Passwords can be compromised through:
  - Data breaches
  - Phishing attacks
  - Brute force attacks
  - Social engineering

💡 **Solution: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- Add an extra layer of security
- Require "something you know" + "something you have"
- Significantly reduce unauthorized access risk

---

## Slide 3: Project Objectives
**Main Goals:**

✅ **Build a minimal web application** using Flask framework
✅ **Store user credentials** securely in database
✅ **Generate random OTP** after password validation
✅ **Send OTP to user's email** (console simulation + real SMTP)
✅ **Verify OTP** before granting access
✅ **Demonstrate extra layer** of authentication
✅ **Teach practical 2FA implementation**

---

## Slide 4: Technical Architecture
**System Design Overview:**

```
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
         ↕
Flask Web Framework
         ↕
SQLite Database
         ↕
SMTP Email System
```

**Key Components:**
- **Authentication System**: Username/Password + OTP verification
- **Database Layer**: Users and OTPs tables with relationships
- **Email Integration**: SMTP with HTML templates
- **Session Management**: Secure authentication state tracking

---

## Slide 5: Database Schema
**Data Structure Design:**

**Users Table:**
- id (Primary Key)
- username (Unique)
- email (Unique)
- password_hash (SHA-256)
- created_at (Timestamp)

**OTPs Table:**
- id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key)
- otp_code (6-digit)
- created_at (Timestamp)
- expires_at (5-minute limit)
- used (Boolean flag)

---

## Slide 6: Authentication Flow
**Step-by-Step Process:**

1️⃣ **Registration**
   - User creates account (username, email, password)
   - Password hashed with SHA-256
   - Stored in SQLite database

2️⃣ **Login Phase 1**
   - User enters credentials
   - System validates username/password
   - If valid, proceed to Phase 2

3️⃣ **OTP Generation**
   - Generate 6-digit random code
   - Set 5-minute expiry time
   - Send via email (HTML template)

4️⃣ **Login Phase 2**
   - User enters OTP from email
   - System validates code and expiry
   - Mark OTP as used (single-use)

5️⃣ **Access Granted**
   - Create secure session
   - Redirect to protected dashboard

---
